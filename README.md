The Scatter plot reflects number of enrolments in various fields in higher education over two decade. We observe that Arts has most enrolments in higher education and has a consistent growth over the decades. Science and Veterinary Science also has good number of enrolments and has shown steady growth. Engineering has shown a sharp increase in enrolments in last decade. This reflects overall progress in Science and Engineering in India over last decade. Fields like Education and Agriculture has shown little growth and has less number of enrolments.

The Box Plot reflects crimes against Schduled Tribes in various part of India. As we can see, states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Chattishgarh have high number of crimes compared to other states. One interesting observation is, Uttar Pradesh, inspite of being adjacent to Madhya Pradesh and Rajashthan, does not have high crime rate. Also, all states show consistency in the numbers over the decade due to low varriance. This reflects that, situatuion of schduled tribe community has not improved in that decade in various part of India.

The Bar Plot reflects cyber crime rates in the states of India in 2020. As we can see, number of chargesheeted persons are very high in UP and Karnataka. Also, we can see, very few people have been acquitted all over India. This reflects better management of cyber crimes in India during pandemic.
