# matplotlibplots
This repo provides some data visualisation using Matplotlib.

We have used two datasets from Kaggle. 
First data set consists $CO_2$ emission data and population data of countries. The visualisation provides insights about how few countries with little proportion of world population contributes to most $CO_2$ emission in the world.

The Second dataset provides data about restaurents from Bangalore. We curated the dataset to obtain which category of foods is popular among restaurents and provided insights about average food price in various part of Bangalore.
